                    Iâ€™m an Information and Communications Technology-Programming and Animation graduate of 
                    Golden Faith Academy in Senior High School. I took Minor subjects, such as Social Science, 
                    Oral Communication, Personal Development, Statistics and Probability, Practical Research, etc., 
                    and Major subjects,  Computer Programming 1-3; Animation 1-4; Media and Information Literacy, 
                    Empowerment Technologies, etc. With that, I learned how to create and manipulate data and 
                    perform operations with formulas and functions in Microsoft Excel. I can do basic console
                    programming, and I, together with my groupmates, successfully made a game using slide share 
                    for our Capstone Project. I also learned about photography and simple animation. <br><br><br>

                    As a 2nd-year Information Technology student at Rizal Technological University, I got 
                    the opportunity to learn different programming languages like C++ and MySQL and now have 
                    a deeper understanding of Java. I also learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made 
                    our group the console for the Payroll Management System as our final project for Computer 
                    Programming 1. I also managed to make a system with GUI along with my group mates for 
                    Computer Programming 2. Both systems use C++ as the language. My groupmates and I also 
                    made a website for our final project and a database using MS Access.
